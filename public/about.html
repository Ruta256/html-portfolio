<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>

<p>
Hi, I'm Rūta, currently on a new self-learner journey as a web developer.</br>
</br>
In the recent years I've graduated from Vilnius University, Economics (bachelor's degree, majoring in the Finance sector). </br>

</br>

I've tried many times to find my passion in life, and even though I was always good at logical/number-related tasks, that did not gave
me the satisfaction, that I was searching for. Thus, since I always were a people person, I've decided to try out the field of HR. </br>

</br>

Through the current position as a People Support Generalist I was able to understand more about client services, their needs and the
IT sector in general, through our systems in the company. That allowed me to come to the conclusion, that in order for a user to
have a nice experience in the company or by buying a product, it's very first interaction would be the most important one of all.
And the very first interaction that the user 90% of the time receives is heald non other than through the web page itself.</br>

</br>

I though: "How awesome would it be to be able to create websites with inner links, customize their view, effectives, visualizaion and where they can 
lead the end user to go to". It would be as if I was enabling the user to travel through the web page, by creating small maps inside,
behind the "closed doors". Similarly as the saying "First impressions are the most important ones", a web page allows us to understand
what are the company values, what do they do, specialise in, with what do they try to capture the first attention of the user.
And for us, as front end developers, the web shows where do we put our priorities first.</br>

</br>
Beforehand, there were no woman in my close field of friends, who wanted to get to know more about programming.
The first impressions were that the IT would be man specific field. However, after my first searches, when I was able to create a simple
HTML based web page from scratch, I felt inspired. I though how many other possibilities  for web pages are there?
And thus, that's how my journey, as an upcoming web developer began.</br>

</br>
Thank you for joining and reading my page! Feel free to "hit me up" for opportunities!</br>

</br>
Don't loose your spark.</br>
Best of luck,</br>
Rūta</br>
