<H1>Favorite Movies/Series Of All Time</H1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies/Series of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<ul>

<li><h3>"Spirited Away"</h3></li>
<p>
Spirited away is one of the most beautiful animated movies of all time. It's visualization and music are some-what out of this world.
I'm a big fan of food and one of my passions in life is cooking delicious meals, that can be shared with loved ones.
Thus, when the movie shows the "picturesque-like" meals, I can't stop myself but dream, of how awesome it would be
to try them! Not to mention the storyline, that captures the "root of the heart". </br>

</br>

It does not matter what your age is, just like drinking hot broth when you're sick,  
if you hit-up "Spirited away", it will be a cozy evening for the whole family to enjoy. </br>
</br>

The director - Hayao Miyazaki - would be a master in capturising and showing the beauty of simple moments in life.
</p>

<li><h3> "The Office"</h3></li>

<p>
There is a saying "Old, but gold". </br>
</br>
"The Office" would be a timeless masterpiece. I loved how in such simplicity the show represents the daily-life of full-time employees. 
It shows different values, different lifestyles and approach to life in all characters</br>
</br>
All in all, colleagues become more than acquaintances. And that's the beauty of the main storyline (all together with the righ humor, of course)</br>
</p>

<li><h3>"Friends"</h3></li>
<p>
As in life, the show represents when friends become family.
We all have friends (or a part of ourselves), that:
    <ul>
        <li>Are sarcastic-funny as "Chandler"</li>
        <li>Have PTSD of cleaning as "Monica"</li>
        <li>Are a foodie as "Joey" ("How you doing?")</li>
        <li>Are a bit "fluky" as "Phoebe"</li>
        <li>Are a shopaholic as "Rachel"</li>
        <li>Are obssesed with our rutines, as Ross is with his dianosours</li>
    </ul> </br>

It's one of those series, where you know, that you'll smile in each and every one serie. </br>

</br>
So, al in all, the main question remains... Where Ross and rachel on a break, or not?
